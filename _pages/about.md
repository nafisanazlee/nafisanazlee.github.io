This is Nafisa Karim Nazlee, an undergraduate student at [BRAC University](https://bracu.ac.bd) majoring in Mathematics with minors in Physics and Computer science. I make notes on interesting classes I attend, and you can find the notes [here](https://nafisanazlee.github.io/notes/). I also like to sing, paint and play the guitar sometimes. I am also interested in philosophy and linguistics.
