This is Nafisa Karim Nazlee, an undergraduate student at [BRAC University](https://bracu.ac.bd). My interests include Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. I make notes on interesting classes I attend, and you can find the notes [here](https://nafisanazlee.github.io/notes/). I enjoy singing, painting, and occasionally playing the guitar. I'm also interested in philosophy and linguistics.
